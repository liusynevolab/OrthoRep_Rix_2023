## Experiment

Subsets of mutations from SgtKis were transplanted onto the Trixy polymerase, and the resulting polymerases in addition to some control polymerases were transformed into a strain harboring mScarlettI encoded on p1.
Cells were passaged for ~80 generations, and the first and last timepoints were sequenced using nanopore. At least two biological replicates per polymerase variant were used

## Analysis

No special analysis in addition to maple was used

## Results

The two mutations to residues 474 and 488 produced a large increase in mutation rate, including large increases in rates of individual substitution types
