## Experiment

Clones from 4 libraries of TPDNAPs that were first enriched using ura3*, then screened via trp5* reversion, therefore were harboring pGKL1Î”::LEU2-ura3*-trp5* (pGR481) (~4.8 kb). 12 clones that looked good in trp5* fluctuation assay were Sanger sequenced, and 6 were chosen based on their sequence and mutation frequency to be subject to mutation accumulation. Clones were passaged 10 times 1:1024, so for ~100 generations.  The first and last timepoint were sequenced using nanopore. Samples for each timepoint/polymerase combination were composed of DNA isolated from a mixture of four replicates of that sample. 

## Analysis

No special analysis was used beyond maple

## Results

About 100 or so sequences were demultiplexed for each sample/timepoint combination. Mutation rate analysis indicated that the D3 variant containing P680T had both the highest mutation rate and the highest level of diversity by pairwise hamming distance in the final timepoint
