# runs to be analyzed, organized into separate run 'tags'
runs:

    DE3-TRP5-P0: # `tag` that describes the sequencing data being analyzed. applied to filenames for pipeline outputs. Must be a string. If a numerical tag is desired, it must be flanked with quotation marks to convert it to a string.

        # for .fast5 input. list of folder names that hold raw fast5 data in a reads directory ( {storage_data_raw}/{runname}/reads/ ). After basecalling, fastq files from each of these will be combined in a directory for this tag ( sequences/batches/{tag}/{runname}/ ).

This can dramatically speed up hamming distance calculation at the cost of not capturing all sequences. Set to False to use all genotypes

genotypes2D_plot_point_color_col: NT_substitutions_count       # genotypes column to use for color of data points. any genotypes column is an option, though some are obviously bad choices. numerical columns will be colored continuously from white to deep blue, categorical columns will be colored as rainbow. default depends on the genotypes.csv file being used.
