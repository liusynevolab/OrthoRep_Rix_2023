## Experiment

Error prone PCR using the TKS polymerase as a template was used to generate a ~10,000 member library in yeast. This library was subject either to sequential URA3, then TRP5 selection, denoted as DS for double selection, or URA3 selection followed by TRP5 fluctuation assay, denoted as FA for fluctuation assay. Colonies derived from double selection or clones that demonstrated higher mutation frequency by fluctuation assay were subject to 10 1:128 passages (70 generations total), and p1 sequences at the first and final passages were extracted and sequenced by nanopore using the E coli downsampled UMI consensus strategy. The polymerase variants from 6 clones at timepoint 0 were sequenced, resulting in identification of only 2 distinct polymerases (2 replicates of Trixy, only one of which had not been cross contaminated by the end of the experiment and was thus excluded from analysis, and 4 replicates of Sgt Kis)

## Analysis

No special analysis in addition to maple was used. Only samples that were present in both the first and last timepoints and had the same polymerase at both timepoints were used for analysis.

## Results

The variant assigned the designation Trixy had a dramatically higher mutation rate than any prior polymerase measured. The SgtKis variant looked similar in mutation rate to previous mutation rate analyses but its mutation spectrum was markedly shifted relative to other polymerases.
